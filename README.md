# REST-Project2
A RESTful service written in Java. A WAR file is used to run this service and I used Postman to test it.

This service was assigned as a small school project with limited time to complete it. The Validation class is very simplistic as a result. 

The file "companydata.jar" was provided by the professor with the assignment and is not my code. It contains a database of employee and timecard information to be accessed and mutated by my service. 

The 2 word documents are provided by the professor. "Server Programming Project 2 Assignment" is the assignment specifications that I followed. "DataLayer Documentation" is the professor's documentation for interacting with the provided "companydata.jar".
